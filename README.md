# Codestellation 2020 Submission: Floppy Pilly

https://devpost.com/software/floppy-pilly-the-game

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for Floppy Pilly was that we wanted to try a new skill and create a game. None of us had experience in game development before and during this hackathon, we believed it would be a good time try to learn something new. We decided to make a silly game with simple mechanics called Floppy Pilly that would be fun to play and watch.

## What it does
As you flop around the level, trying to defeat the poison pills and cyanide tablets. You can do so buy stomping on them. Pilly has three lives so when you collide with an enemy, you end up at the beginning of the level with a one less life until you complete the level or die.

## How we built it
We built the game using Unity and C#

## Challenges we ran into
One of the challenges we had was building a game from scratch while learning to use Unity at the same time. As mentioned previously, we didn't have any experience in game development, so we were all required to learn how to use Unity through tutorials. Another challenge we had was designing the characters because since they were 3D models, we had to learn how to design the characters so that none of the features would be stretched out.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
The accomplishments we are proud of are that we were able to work together as a team even while we were remote. It was easier to communicate with resources such as zoom and discord. We are also proud that we were able to make two levels for the game and complete it within the allotted time even though this was our first time working with unity and for some, our first time working with C#

## What we learned
Our team learned how to properly use Unity and features we were able to create to make the game more entertaining even though it is fairly short.

## What's next for Floppy Pilly - The Game
What's next is that we would like to implement a pause and scoring mechanism. Our original plan was that when Pilly would collect coins and increase the score. We also wanted to add an interface where players would be able to see how many remaining lives they have and what their current score is.
